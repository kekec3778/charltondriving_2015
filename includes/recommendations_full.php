                    &ldquo;I had convinced myself that I would never learn, and certainly never pass! Having had several instructors before I was aware how crucial getting the right person was. Neil is patient, calm and flexible. I always felt listened to and went from dreading my lessons to looking forward to them. Today I have passed first time and I can not believe it. With 3 kids and 2 businesses having this freedom will change my life. Neil's online resources are great and having an online portal to follow up on makes the most of each lesson. Its been brilliant and the only down side of passing is missing my weekly lessons. Thank you!&rdquo; <br>

                    &ldquo;Neil is a fantastic and skilled driving instructor who has a great sense of humour, immeasurable calm and patience.

                    Prior to having Neil as my driving instructor, I failed my driving test twice and was convinced I would never be able to drive.  
                    However, with Neil's help I was happily proven wrong and passed the first time with him as my instructor.  

                    From my own personal experience, I believe one of the main things that sets Neil apart from other driving instructors is that he tries to put himself in his client's shoes to understand the barriers they are facing when learning to drive and then finding a way (or ways) to overcome those mental obstacles or bad driving habits.  Needless to say, he's patient, understanding and encouraging.  He's committed into getting you to drive safely and well and with the aim of achieving that pass. 

                    I genuinely can't recommend him highly enough. &rdquo;

                    &ldquo;Would definitely recommend Neil as a driving instructor! At the start I was a very nervous driver. However Neil has been patient and encouraging all the way through, which has really built my confidence. He is a skilled instructor, great to talk to and very supportive. The lessons are well structured, tailored to your ability and there is flexibility to focus on things you feel would be useful as well. After every lesson you receive feedback and breakdown of what was covered. Neil also provides online support and materials, which are incredibly helpful. Thank you so much Neil for teaching me to drive (something that I thought would be an impossible task!), you’ve been the best teacher!!&rdquo;

                    &ldquo;It's all true. Neil is a lovely person and a very clever teacher. He has a truly contagious sense of calm, is encouraging and you're never made to feel silly. Despite being a freaked out first time adult learner, I quickly gained confidence and passed first time! Couldn't recommend more highly.<br> I was blown away by the website - a great resource when I was revising for my theory but also an easy way to keep tabs on progress, hours, money spent. You can see tips and videos that relate to each lesson and notes on what you've been working on.<br>
                    The whole experience was super positive. Before I knew it Neil told me I was ready to take the test. I'm going to miss those lessons! Thank you! &rdquo;

                    &ldquo;I failed my driving test three times in my early 20s.  I unluckily had a terrible instructor the first time I learnt, who would shout when I made a mistake. After the third attempt at the driving test I stopped learning.   Thinking about driving put me in a blind panic, and I had resigned myself to forever live in London, to negate the need to ever drive again.   The whole experience learning to drive with that first instructor, really knocked my confidence, and it was another decade before I decided to learn again. 
                    <br>
                    I booked my first lesson with Neil purely because he had good reviews on his website, from people exactly like me.  The reviews did not disappoint.   From the first lesson to the last hour before my test, Neil has always been very calm and encouraging.  Neil is an excellent teacher and good at explaining things.   As a veteran Instructor he is attuned to his student’s needs, learning styles, and adapts to what suits.  He will go over manoeuvres, roundabouts, where the window washer is, until you get it.  As far as possible he attempts to teach you good habits, and tries to instil a good attitude driving.   On top of that he is a pleasant person to spend an hour with every week with, and will bend your ear off anything Star Wars. related.  <br>

                    Learning to drive is a bit like learning to read,  it is important, and you should be able to do it well.  I don’t remember who taught me how to read, but I will definitely remember who taught me how to drive properly.  Having achieved my driver’s license, I now realise how much more freedom I have.  For that, I am grateful to Neil for his time and effort teaching me.<br>
                    I would 100% recommend Neil as a driving instructor, if you’re anything like me don’t wait just start learning!&rdquo;<br>

                    &ldquo;Neil is a brilliant driving instructor. With his help I passed my driving test on my first attempt. I had been anxious about driving after a bad experience with a previous instructor but Neil completely restored my confidence. He is reliable, punctual and incredibly patient. He knew exactly how far to push me to improve and structured the lessons really well, so there was a constant feeling of progression. The online support and feedback he provides outside of lessons were also incredibly useful tools. I highly recommend him. Thank you very much Neil, it’s been an absolute pleasure!&rdquo;<br>

                    &ldquo;After having two previous driving instructors that repeatedly cancelled lessons last minute or turned up late I decided to try Neil. He was recommended to me by my boss at work who said he was great at teaching her to drive. I can say that Neil was brilliant, he was punctual, professional and always willing to give extra help. He used special tricks and reference points for manoeuvres that I found really useful. After using him for approximately 5 months I passed the first time at Hither Green. I would fully recommend him to anyone.&rdquo;<br>

He makes everything more easier by explaining why I went wrong and praising me when I did right which boosts my confidence. He did not waste any time, he always got straight to the point by teaching me things he felt I needed to improve in preparation for my test. I hugely enjoyed my time with him and I will always be grateful for having the opportunity to learn from him, I would not be a qualified driver now if it was not for him. I taught him some BSL (British sign language) which he did very well, he would not stop trying his best so this shows his attitude to disabled individuals are amazing. So rest assured, you are in the good hands if you have him as your driving instructor :)&rdquo;<br>

He gives 100% or more to teaching. He is a patient, extremely knowledgeable teacher. If you really want to be a skilled driver and feel confident at what you do then pick Neil. A lot of the skills he was teaching me was at advanced level driving. I feel very grateful for Neil getting me through my test. I passed, yay!&rdquo;<br>

                <p class="rec">&ldquo;When I rang Neil to book an initial lesson I was feeling quite despondent about my ability to ever pass the driving test. I had taken, and failed, two driving tests previously and had had three different driving instructors.  I was finding it very difficult to find an instructor that I clicked with.  My previous instructors seemed either too laid back and I felt I wasn't learning and progressing.  Alternatively they were rather pedantic and particular and I was left feeling anxious and flustered. So I googled 'experienced' and 'patient' driving instructor and Neil's driving school was at the top of the list. I knew I had found the right driving instructor in my very first lesson.  Neil is indeed experienced and patient but he also challenged me when I needed to push myself a little.  Simultaneously he maintained a relaxed and fun atmosphere and I found I was actually enjoying my driving lessons! I felt confident and prepared when it came time for me to attempt my third driving test.. and I passed! I would recommend Neil to anyone who is a nervous or demoralised learner driver.  Thanks to him I am now finally mobile and transporting two small children from A to B is so much easier!&rdquo; <br>
