                    &ldquo;Neil is a fantastic and skilled driving instructor who has a great sense of humour, immeasurable calm and patience.

                    Prior to having Neil as my driving instructor, I failed my driving test twice when I was younger and was convinced I would never be able to drive.  
                    However, with Neil's help I was happily proven wrong and passed the first time with him as my instructor.  

                    From my own personal experience, I believe one of the main things that sets Neil apart from other driving instructors is that he tries to put himself in his client's shoes to understand the barriers they are facing when learning to drive and then finding a way (or ways) to overcome those mental obstacles or bad driving habits.  Needless to say, he's patient, understanding and encouraging.  He's committed into getting you to drive safely and well and with the aim of achieving that pass. 

                    I genuinely can't recommend him highly enough. &rdquo;

                    &ldquo;Would definitely recommend Neil as a driving instructor! At the start I was a very nervous driver. However Neil has been patient and encouraging all the way through, which has really built my confidence. He is a skilled instructor, great to talk to and very supportive. The lessons are well structured, tailored to your ability and there is flexibility to focus on things you feel would be useful as well. After every lesson you receive feedback and breakdown of what was covered. Neil also provides online support and materials, which are incredibly helpful. Thank you so much Neil for teaching me to drive (something that I thought would be an impossible task!), you’ve been the best teacher!!&rdquo;

                    &ldquo;After having two previous driving instructors that repeatedly cancelled lessons last minute or turned up late I decided to try Neil. He was recommended to me by my boss at work who said he was great at teaching her to drive. I can say that Neil was brilliant, he was punctual, professional and always willing to give extra help. He used special tricks and reference points for manoeuvres that I found really useful. After using him for approximately 5 months I passed the first time at Hither Green. I would fully recommend him to anyone.&rdquo;<br>

                <p class="rec">&ldquo;Once we started the first lesson, I knew straight away Neil was going to be my last driving instructor with his positive attitude towards my deafness and throughout the lessons we had over the time, he was very calm, patient, honest and friendly. He makes everything more easier by explaining why I went wrong and praising me when I did right which boosts my confidence. He did not waste any time, he always got straight to the point by teaching me things he felt I needed to improve in preparation for my test. I hugely enjoyed my time with him and I will always be grateful for having the opportunity to learn from him, I would not be a qualified driver now if it was not for him. I taught him some BSL (British sign language) which he did very well, he would not stop trying his best so this shows his attitude to disabled individuals are amazing. So rest assured, you are in the good hands if you have him as your driving instructor :)&rdquo;<br>

Neil really cares about the people he works with, and more importantly he makes you feel that you can do it. He always focuses on the positive aspects of your lesson. The lessons are well structured and I always felt confident that I would pass my test with Neil.  I would not recommend anyone else.&rdquo;<br>

                <p class="rec">&ldquo;Thank you for all those wonderful driving lessons you gave me over the past year. Your friendly manner and your professionalism made my learning, in the earlier stages, stress free and after your attention to detail and constant guidance made me gain confidence and my joy of driving grew every day, but the best thing you have done for me is giving me first steps for a safe confident driving that for me and my son is the most important.
                    Thank you so much for your advice, your professionalism, your adaptability and for understands so well my needs and adapting to my learning patterns.

He is patient, thorough, and will make sure you not only pass your test but learn really good driving habits to last you a lifetime. He is also great company - a really important quality in a driving instructor given that you spend hours on end with them! Absolutely delighted with my first-time pass, and will recommend the Charlton Driving School to everyone I know.&rdquo;<strong><br>

                <p class="rec">&ldquo;I came to driving later in life therefore I chose my driving instructor very carefully. I read the testimonials of several instructors and Charlton Driving School stood out the most. I also spoke to other people who had used them and their positive comments influenced my decision. As a teacher, I understand the fine line between challenging students and stressing them; thankfully so does Neil. He made me feel confident and in control very early in my driving. Furthermore, Charlton Driving School's friendly and flexible meant I was easily able to accomodate my learning into a fairly hectic schedule. Neil is a great guy and a brilliant instructor; highly recommend for drivers' of all ages and abilities. &rdquo;<br>

                <p class="rec">&ldquo;I would thoroughly recommend Neil.  He was always punctual, reliable and professional, and his instruction was first class.  He develops the skills you will need not only to pass the exam, but also to be a safe, considerate and confident driver in the years to come.  I was terrified of London roads when I first stepped into his car, and he was always constructive and patient, progressing at a rate that was perfect for me.  I could not have passed my exam first time with only two minors without him.  Most importantly, he is a great guy, and I always enjoyed my lessons!&rdquo;<br>

                <p class="rec">&ldquo;I can strongly recommend Charlton Driving School. The lessons were not only fun but also very informative. Neil teaches you how to be a confident and considerate driver, not just how to pass your test. I am a keen cyclist and he would relate my past experience to everyday driving. Even my partner (who has had his licence for years) would learn lots of new and interesting facts from my post lesson rambles. I can drive confidently despite the best efforts of my two screaming children in the back.&rdquo;<i><br>

                <p class="rec">“I thoroughly enjoyed my driving lessons with Neil.  The relaxed, flexible structure of the lessons allowed me to focus on the areas which needed more practice, without feeling I was falling behind.  As a particularly nervous learner, Neil's calm manner and quiet confidence helped me to relax and gain the confidence I lacked very quickly.  The whole learning experience for me was very positive - topped off with a pass first time!  Thank you Neil.” <br>
