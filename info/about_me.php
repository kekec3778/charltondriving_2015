                <p>I have been a driving teacher for <strong>12 years, with over 12,000 hours</strong> of experience.
                <p> I love my job. I love driving and really enjoy teaching people of <strong>all ages, abilites and nationalities</strong>. Whether you're age 17 and can't wait to get going, age 60 and have been putting it off for 40 years or if you've failed tests in the past. I don't mind. I'll teach you.</p>
                <p>I won't get angry if you make a mistake, and will always try to encourage a positive driving attitude. </p>
                <p> I am a full member of the two leading <strong>advanced driving organizations</strong> in Britain: The <acronym title="Institute of Advanced Motorists"><strong>I.A.M.</strong></acronym> and <acronym title="Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents"><strong>RoSPA</strong></acronym>. You can be sure you are being trained by an approved driving enthusiast. </p>
